# Nooks

Nooks: An app that centralizes all the information about the best study spots on Cornell's campus.

Nooks helps fellow Cornellians know the hours of the major study spaces such as the many libraries with varying hours. By accesing Cornell's library hours API, users will be accurately infromed on whether a desired library is open. Users have the ability to explore all the different study spaces in the Home tab, either through scrolling or searching either by name or by location on campus. The Map view adds additional functionality as users can choose to use their current location, in turn showing how far away  they are from respective libraries. The Map view also use dynamic pins that change their color depending whether the library is open or closed. Users can favorite their most sought after study spaces and access them directly in the Favorites tab as well. Lastly in addition to the hours each Library has a detailed view that highlights the different rooms within that library and their respective volume levels, caf√©s within the library as well as different services that the library provides such as rentals and prinitng.

Nooks does not yet accomplish all of our envisioned features such as allowing the user to reserve study rooms in advance, dynamically display the hours of operation as an animation in the detailed view for any library, and displaying a bar graph within the detailed view that depicts the how busy each location is at certain times. We would also have liked to further build on Cornell's library API to include various other study locations on campus that are not considered to be libraries.
